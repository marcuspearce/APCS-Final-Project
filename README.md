# APCS-Final-Project

This is my final project from my APCS course I took junior year of high school - a recreation of Pacman (renamed for our
teacher Mr. Peck). It incorporates object-oriented design and a queue data structure to create a game that plays very 
similarly to the original; the ghosts each have unique movement patterns which adapt to a given situation, Pacman interacts
with the map as he should, scores and lives are recorded and incremented correctly and there is a "hypemode" when Pacman
can briefly eat the ghosts while they run away. 

We used the java-oriented environment Greenfoot to help create the GUI. We developed the individual classes and methods 
in Eclipse in Java from scratch. 

A more detailed overview of the project and how it works can be found in the Specification folder in the file
